# vs-stats
VapourSynth module for acquiring information on (variable) video.
Provides functions for splitting video by resolution, format, or both.

## Future additions
This module will, at some point in time, be a more general analytics package that will be able to
provide data about video, optionally writing the related info to frameprops or returning the info
as objects. Possibly using `Mapping`s, `Sequence`s or other collection types depending on the
situation. All in all, it's still a very much in-development package.
